<p><strong>What We&#39;re About:</strong></p>
<p>DHEA is a group of artists working together in the digital world. We believe in the power of art and want to make sure it isn&#39;t lost in the online world. Our goal is to build a community where artists can support each other, share their work, and create amazing projects together. </p>
<p><strong>Addressing Recent Issues:</strong></p>
<p>We&#39;ve had some disagreements in DHEA lately about individual freedom within the group. We want to be clear: <strong>DHEA is about bringing unique voices together, not forcing everyone to be the same.</strong> We want everyone to feel comfortable expressing themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing right away:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Discussion:</strong> We&#39;ll have a virtual meeting where everyone can share their concerns, ideas, and hopes for DHEA.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Agreement:</strong> We&#39;ll write a document together that outlines our shared values, how we&#39;ll communicate, make decisions, and work together. This will also explain the difference between personal projects and DHEA collaborations, making it clear that joining DHEA projects is always a choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Plan:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Building Our Foundation (September 7th - September 21st, 2024)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define Our Vision:</strong> We&#39;ll create a guide that explains DHEA&#39;s artistic style and ideas. This isn&#39;t a rulebook, but a reference for those who want to join our projects.</li>
<li><strong>Build Our Website (doll.network):</strong> We&#39;ll design our website to include artist profiles, a blog for discussions, a portfolio of our work, and a section dedicated to DHEA&#39;s story and world.</li>
<li><strong>Find Like-Minded Artists:</strong> We&#39;ll invite artists who share our vision to join DHEA. We&#39;ll be upfront that joining projects is voluntary and highlight the benefits of showcasing both individual and collaborative work on our website.</li>
<li><strong>Welcome New Members:</strong> We&#39;ll create a welcoming process for new members, introducing them to DHEA&#39;s values, guidelines, and upcoming projects.</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorm Project Ideas:</strong> We&#39;ll hold a brainstorming session with all members to come up with creative project ideas that combine music, visuals, and maybe even interactive elements for our website. </li>
<li><strong>Choose Our First Projects:</strong> We&#39;ll choose a few top project ideas and clearly define their goals, deliverables, roles, timelines, and a flexible structure for collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Sharing Our Work (September 22nd - October 20th, 2024)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch Our Projects:</strong> We&#39;ll kick off our chosen projects, ensuring everyone is on the same page and contributes in their own way.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Our Website:</strong> We&#39;ll finish building doll.network, making it user-friendly and visually appealing, with a focus on individual artist pages and a constantly growing world and story.</li>
<li><strong>Share Our Thoughts:</strong> We&#39;ll use our website to share blog posts, artist statements, and behind-the-scenes looks at our individual and collaborative work.</li>
<li><strong>Spread the Word:</strong> We&#39;ll use social media to connect with others, share our creative process, and build a community that values both individual expression and collective effort.</li>
<li><strong>Create Merchandise:</strong> We&#39;ll design limited-edition merchandise that represents DHEA&#39;s spirit, allowing fans to show their support for the collective and individual artists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong></p>
<p>DHEA is constantly evolving. We believe in open communication, mutual respect, and valuing everyone&#39;s creativity. By combining individual expression and collaboration, we aim to create lasting art in the digital world, proving that art driven by passion will always have a place. </p>
